How I would structure the Pong-Game: 

Classes: 
- Paddles
- Scoreboard
- Ball

Converge these classes in a main file called pong.py

Structure: 
1. Create the screen [DONE]
2. Create and move a paddle 
3. Create another paddle
4. Create the ball and make it move
5. Detect collision with wall and bounce 
6. Detect collision with paddle
7. Detect when paddle misses 
8. Keep score in a Scoreboard
