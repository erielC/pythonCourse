I dont know how to commit correctly

If using on a different device and get error that
"unrelated histories cannot be merged" then run
git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories (in terminal of vscode)
ex. address \***\*Documents\GitHub\pythonCourse> git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories\*\***

Update 1//3/2024:
I decided to read a bit of documentation and realized that my code is a mess because of the casing since im used to Java and now my programs will be followed with PascalCase and snake_case
